# Wistia Thumbnail Generator

### Details
Useful tool to get the url and the image for a Wistia video's thumbnail in any desired size by just using its ID.

#### Usage
1. Enter your Wistia account subdomain (**company**.wistia.com)
2. Enter the ID from the Wistia video (...wistia.com/medias/**12345abdce**)
3. Enter the **width** and **height** for the desired thumbnail

And that's it! It spits out a URL for you to use as the `src` for an `img` tag or whatever else you might need it for!
